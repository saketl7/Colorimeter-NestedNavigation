In this example each tab has its own navigation stack. This is so that we donâ€™t lose the navigation history when switching tabs.

This is a very common use case for a lot of apps.

**How is it built?**

- Create an app with a `Scaffold` and a `BottomNavigationBar`.
- In the `Scaffold` body, create a `Stack` with one child for each tab.
- Each child is an `Offstage` widget with a child `Navigator`.
- Don't forget to handle Android back navigation with `WillPopScope`.
